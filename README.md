# Overview

In order to learn and practice with c++ I created this software to make a deck of cards that I could create games with. 
I did this because I felt it was a good fit for an object oriented language.

# Development Environment

I developed this using Visual Studio. I used C++ to create a variety of classes that can store the data of a trick taking card game such as hearts or spades.
